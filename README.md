# 📈 Financial Risk Analytics & Portfolio Modeling (Python)

This project demonstrates core competencies required for Financial Engineering (FE) and Market Risk roles, focusing on the quantitative analysis of market data using Python.

**Target Roles:** Market Risk Analyst, Financial Engineering Intern (JPMC, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley).

## 🚀 Key Features and Concepts Demonstrated

| Feature | FE/Risk Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VaR Engine** | Historical Value-at-Risk (VaR) | Core regulatory risk measure used by all investment banks. |
| **Volatility Analysis** | Returns calculation, Volatility Clustering | Essential for trading desk risk limits and advanced model building. |
| **Portfolio Setup** | Covariance Matrix, Correlation | Foundation for diversification and capital allocation (next steps). |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📊 Project Output: VaR Calculation

The primary goal of the initial module was to calculate the 99% Daily Historical VaR for a single asset (using $\text{AAPL}$ or your chosen stock).

**Calculated 99% Daily VaR:**

* **Daily Volatility (Std Dev):** [INSERT YOUR VOLATILITY NUMBER HERE]
* **99% Daily VaR (Percentage):** [INSERT YOUR PERCENTAGE VaR HERE - e.g., 0.0424]
* **99% Daily VaR on \$100k Portfolio:** **\$4,241.65**

**Interpretation:** There is a 99% probability that the portfolio will not lose more than $\text{\$4,241.65}$ in a single trading day.

## ⚙️ Next Steps (Future Modules)

This project is actively being expanded to cover complex portfolio risk management:

1.  **Portfolio Optimization:** Implementing the Markowitz Mean-Variance framework.
2.  **Efficient Frontier:** Calculating and plotting the optimal risk-return trade-off for multiple assets.
3.  **Stress Testing:** Running Monte Carlo simulations to model extreme market scenarios.
